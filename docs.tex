\section{Battery Charging}
\subsection{Connections}
Plug the charger into the mains using a three-pronged AC cable into the black AC port, or into the orange DC port if you have a DC cable with adapter.
To plug in the battery, first put the orange DC to positive/negative adapter on it, and then connect that to the positive and negative jacks on station 3 on the charger.
Do not plug the orange connector directly into the charging station, this is an input connection and will not charge the battery.
